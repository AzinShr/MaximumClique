# MaximumClique
 Maximal Clique Problem: given a group of vertices some of which have edges in between them, the maximal clique is the largest subset of 
 vertices in which each point is directly connected to every other vertex in the subset. 
 Every time a new point is added, the number of total cliques that must be searched at least doubles; hence we have an exponentially growing problem
